## Introduction

The **Open Network for Education Skilling Transaction (ONEST)** is a groundbreaking initiative under ONDC that aims to create an inclusive and interoperable digital ecosystem for education and skilling. Built on the principles of decentralization, ONEST enables seamless transactions and interactions among education providers, learners, institutions, and other stakeholders.

By adhering to the ONEST specifications, stakeholders can ensure interoperability, scalability, and transparency in delivering and accessing education and skilling resources. The initiative aims to bridge gaps in education and skill development, fostering a learner-centric ecosystem.
